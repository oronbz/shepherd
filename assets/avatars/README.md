# Avatars

Every avatar Shepherd can wear is drawn in code by `tools/avatars/`: ink outlines with a slight hand wobble and pencil hatching, rendered at 4× and downsampled. No image generator is involved, and rebuilding unchanged code reproduces the committed PNGs exactly.

| Avatar | Look |
|---|---|
| `ram` (Ram, default) | Herdr's ram as an eSheep-style desktop sheep in Catppuccin Mocha colours: soft lavender wool, a dark face with a rosewater curled horn and a `>_` prompt for an eye. He faces right, trots while working, grazes when idle and naps lying down. |
| `block` (Block) | A hatched terracotta box with two tall eyes, stub arms and four thin legs. |
| `soft-spark` (Soft Spark) | A radial spark with a tall tuft, soft rounded rays, two padded feet and a small smile. |
| `catpuccino` (Catpuccino) | An anime caramel cat with big shiny eyes and round ears, sitting in a cappuccino cup on a saucer, wearing a foam cap with a latte-art heart; his tail is the cup's handle. He kneads the rim while working, pops out cheering when a response ends, waves a pink-beaned paw when an agent needs you and dozes low in the cup. |
| `unicorn` (Unicorn) | A chubby white unicorn sitting front-on, with a pastel rainbow mane and tail, a gold spiral horn, a pink muzzle and lilac hooves. His horn glows and sparkles rise while working, he hops when a response ends, raises a hoof and waves when an agent needs you, dozes with his head tilted and giggles under floating hearts when hovered. |

## Layout

```
assets/avatars/<id>/
  avatar.json        frame map
  idle.png           one horizontal strip per reaction
  working.png
  finished.png
  needs-you.png
  resting.png
  hover.png
```

`avatar.json` (version 2) names the avatar and, for each of the six reactions, its strip, `frameCount`, `playback` and ordered `frames` of `{index, durationMs}` where `index` is a zero-based cell in that strip. A strip is `frameCount × 128` by 128 px RGBA. `loop` repeats, `hold` plays once and keeps its last frame, and `once` ends after its last frame and hands back to whatever Shepherd was showing.

Cells share the ground anchor `(64, 112)`. Every grounded pose's lowest pixel sits on it; hop frames lift off it. Cells display at native 128 px.

## Adding a reaction or an avatar

- A new avatar is a module in `tools/avatars/` exposing `ID`, `NAME`, `NEUTRAL`, `render(pose, seed)` and `ANIMATIONS`, registered in `build.py`, plus a case in the app's `Avatar` enum.
- A new reaction is a new `ANIMATIONS` entry in every avatar module, a new `CompanionAnimation` case, and the verifier's `REACTIONS` set.

## Rebuild and check

Requires Python 3 and Pillow 12.1 or newer.

```sh
python3 tools/avatars/build.py --contact-sheet /tmp/avatars.png
python3 tools/avatars/verify.py
```

The verifier checks each pack's frame map against its strips, antialiased edges, 4 px safe margins, that nothing sinks below the ground and every reaction starts on it, hover head clearance, and stray specks.

## Preview

From the repository root run `python3 -m http.server 8765 --bind 127.0.0.1` and open http://127.0.0.1:8765/tools/avatars/preview/. Pick an avatar and a reaction, pause or replay, and compare light and dark backgrounds at 64, 128 or 192 px.
